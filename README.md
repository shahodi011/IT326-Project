# IT326-Project

Project Introduction:

This project explores an Alzheimer’s Disease dataset that includes details about patients’ health and lifestyles. By looking at this data, we want to see how different factors come together and what patterns can be discovered. It’s an opportunity to connect raw numbers with real-world meaning.


Project Motivation:

Alzheimer’s continues to be a major health concern worldwide. We chose this dataset because it allows us to apply data mining in a meaningful way not just to work with numbers, but to highlight patterns that could support research, raise awareness, and bring new perspectives on how the disease is understood.
